This is a simple web application that solves quadratic equations and displays their graphs using Plotly.js.

Features
Solve quadratic equations of the form ax² + bx + c = 0.
Display the real roots of the quadratic equation, and tell you if the roots are complex.
Graph the quadratic function and highlight the y intercept.

Usage
Open the web application in your browser. - https://iliyanchou.github.io/Quadratics-solver/
Enter the coefficients a, b, and c for the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0.
Click the "Solve" button to see the roots of the equation.
The graph of the quadratic function will be displayed with y intercept marked.
Example
Here is an example of how the app looks and works:


Example Quadratic Equation
For the equation 2x² + 4x - 6 = 0:

Coefficients: a = 2, b = 4, c = -6
Roots: x₁ = 1, x₂ = -3
Graph
The graph of the quadratic function 2x² + 4x - 6 will be plotted, showing the parabolic curve with y intercept highlighted.
